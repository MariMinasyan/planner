## Project Overview
This project is a weekly planner desktop application designed to help marketing teams manage tasks by assigning schedulable events to time slots within a workweek.
The workweek consists of Monday through Friday, each day divided into two discrete time slots:
- Morning
- Afternoon

The application supports both:
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)

and follows object-oriented design principles

## Features
- Add, remove, and inspect scheduled events
- Save and load schedules from files
- Support for multiple schedulable types
- CLI and GUI interfaces with identical functionality
- Comparable and cloneable workweeks

java am.aua.hw.Main
